As it is right now, the server and client both act the same way. They both need to seperate

The server needs to act like a relay to other clients while the client does the heavy load of managing the modules

I would need to write a seperate server instance and provide access libraries that use callback events.

Server APIs would be:
WriteLocal
ReadLocal
CallAPI - Web proxies
